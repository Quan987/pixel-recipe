Recipe for pizza: 
ingredients:
16 ounces pizza dough
18 to 20 slices pepperoni
12 ounces mozzarella cheese, grated
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon fresh oregano, optional
Flour for rolling and shaping dough

For sauce: 
1/2 cup tomato sauce (no salt)
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon granulated garlic
1/2 teaspoon granulated onion
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 teaspoon olive oil

instructions: 

1. Preheat oven to 500°F. If you are using a pizza stone, preheat it in the oven for at least 20 minutes so it is nice and hot as well.

2. Stir together the ingredients for sauce.

3. Roll out dough on a lightly floured surface. If it's hard to roll, let it rest for 5 minutes so it can come to room temperature. 

4. Add sauce in a light layer all over the pizza, leaving about 1/4-inch crust around the edges. 

5. Top the pizza with grated cheese and pepperoni slices. Season with black pepper.

6. Cook for 6 minutes, then rotate the pizza halfway so it cooks evenly. Cook for another 6-8 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and charred in spots.

7. Slice and serve.
